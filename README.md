# First project is Number Guessing 
# Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
How to Play:
Set Your Range:

Think of a range of numbers between which you want to guess. Enter the lower and upper bounds when prompted.
Start Guessing:

You'll have a limited number of chances to guess the secret number. Don't worry; we'll tell you how many tries you have based on the range you've chosen.
Make Your Guesses:

Enter your guesses when prompted. We'll let you know if your guess is too high or too low.
Winning:

If you guess the number correctly, congratulations! We'll tell you how many tries it took. You're a winner!
If you run out of guesses without finding the number, don't worry; we'll reveal the secret number and encourage you to try again.
Tips:
Take your time to think about each guess.
Pay attention to the hints about whether your guess is too high or too low.
With each guess, you're getting closer to finding the secret number!
Enjoy and Have Fun
